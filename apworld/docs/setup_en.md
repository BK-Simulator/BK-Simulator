# BK Simulator Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest), to generate or use text client.

## How to play

- Open the game, connect to your slot.
- Choose which weather to walk to BK in.
- Each time you reach BK, you send a check. You do still need to walk home after, before you can start your next trip!

## Settings
- You choose how many locations are in the game. Collecting ALL of them is required as the goal.
- You can adjust the distance to the nearest BK at the start. This will heavily control the speed / length of the game.
- You can also adjust the speed gained for each speed upgrade.

## Items / Logic
- Shoe upgrades allow you to walk faster
- Snow Boots allow you to walk in snow (and walk faster in snow)
- Opening a new BK location cuts the distance you need to walk in half

- Sunny weather is the standard, and where you should start
- Rainy weather is slower to walk in, and expects that you have more upgrades than sunny weather expects
- Snowy weather requires snow boots to walk in
